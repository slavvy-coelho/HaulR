<li>A video explaining the working of the code in the jupyter notebook and the Tableau Dashboard. 
<li>A jupyter notebook with data cleaning, analysis solution to the problem statement. 
<li>A Tableau Interactive Dashboard showcasing the results. https://public.tableau.com/profile/slavvy.johnson.coelho#!/vizhome/HaulRLogistics/Dashboard1
